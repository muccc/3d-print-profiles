## Slicing Software

### Slic3r and PrusaSlicer

PrusaSlicer is a fork of Slic3r, so they (currently) accept the same configuration files. PrusaSlicer (current Version 2.1.1) has some advanced features and runs more stable than Slic3r (Version 1.3.0)


#### Import/Export in PrusaSlicer
In PrusaSlicer, a combined ini-config file for Print settings, Filament and Printer is generated with ```File -> Export -> Export Config...```.

It can be (re)importet via ```File -> Import -> Import Config...```.

#### Import/Export in Slic3r

In Slic3r, the combined config is generated via ```File -> Export Config...``` and imported via ```File -> Load Config...```
